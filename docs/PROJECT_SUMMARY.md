```bash
./setup.sh
```
This runs a guided setup process that configures everything for you.

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
```bash
# Copy and edit configuration
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Start with Docker
make docker-up
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies and proxy
./install.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Start proxy
make start
```

## 📊 Management Commands

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with convenient commands:

```bash
# Setup and installation
make setup          # Interactive setup
make install        # Manual installation

# Proxy management
make start          # Start proxy
make stop           # Stop proxy
make restart        # Restart proxy
make status         # Check status

# Docker operations
make docker-up      # Start with Docker
make docker-down    # Stop Docker containers
make docker-logs    # View Docker logs

# Monitoring and maintenance
make monitor        # Start monitoring dashboard
make logs           # View recent logs
make health         # Health check
make clean          # Clean temporary files

# Utilities
make secret         # Generate new secret
make links          # Show proxy links
make backup         # Backup configuration
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

The proxy is configured via environment variables in the `.env` file:

### Essential Settings
- `MTG_SECRET`: 32-character hex secret (auto-generated)
- `MTG_PORT`: Listening port (default: 8443)
- `SERVER_HOST`: Public server address
- `MTG_WORKERS`: Number of worker processes

### Security Settings
- `MTG_SECURE_ONLY`: Enable secure mode only
- `MTG_DOMAIN`: Domain for TLS camouflage
- `MTG_DISABLE_IPV6`: Disable IPv6 support
- `MTG_ANTI_REPLAY_MAX_SIZE`: Anti-replay protection

### Performance Settings
- `MTG_BUFFER_SIZE`: Connection buffer size
- `MTG_TIMEOUT`: Connection timeout
- `MTG_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP`: Connection limits

### Monitoring Settings
- `MTG_STATS_ENABLED`: Enable statistics endpoint
- `MTG_STATS_PORT`: Statistics port (default: 3001)
- `MTG_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity

## 📈 Monitoring and Statistics
